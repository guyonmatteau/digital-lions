## Current 
On landing 

`GET /teams/{id}/workshops`
```
[
  {
    "date": "2021-01-01",
    "workshop_number": 1,
    "workshop_id": 1000,
    "attendance": [
      {
        "attendance": "present",
        "child_id": 1,
        "first_name": "Nelson",
        "last_name": "Mandela"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

This is too much because we don't need the attenadance of all children to all workshops on landing, only the status of the team and the workshop info.

## Future state
